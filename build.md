Should technical writers build portfolio?

Building a portfolio as a technical writer is an important step in becoming a more attractive contributor for open-source projects. Here are some steps you can take to build your portfolio:

1. Choose a niche: Decide on a specific area of technical writing that you are interested in and that aligns with your skills and experience. For example, you might specialize in software documentation just like e.g. [python-docx-oss](https://python-docx-oss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), technical blog posts like e.g. [HashiCorp Blog](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog), or video tutorials like e.g. [openstack.org](https://www.openstack.org).

2. Find projects to work on: Look for open-source projects that align with your niche and interests. You can search for projects on e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com/topics/writing-software), [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/) or simply just search online in groups, forums and blogs and choose one or more to contribute to.

3. Contribute to open-source projects: Once you have identified a project to work on, start contributing to it by creating documentation, writing tutorials, or offering other technical writing services e.g. review of others' work, copy editing etc. Make sure to follow the project's guidelines and communicate with the project's maintainers and other contributors.

4. Create a website or blog: A website or blog is a great way to showcase your work as a technical writer. You can use it to share your writing samples, describe your experience, and provide links to your contributions to open-source projects.

5. Share your work on social media: Social media platforms, such as LinkedIn e.g. [one of the LinkedIn Technical Writing-oriented channel gathering 77 000 followers](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/skills-technical-writing/posts/?feedView=all) and Twitter e.g. [Techwriterstribe](https://twitter.com/Techwriterstri1). Those plaforms can be powerful tools for networking and sharing your work as a technical writer. Share links to your website or blog, and engage with other writers and contributors in your niche.

6. Seek feedback: Ask other technical writers and contributors for feedback on your work and use their feedback to improve your writing and build your portfolio.

In summary, to build a portfolio as a technical writer and become more attractive to open source projects, you can choose a niche, find projects to work on, contribute to open source projects, create a website or blog, share your work on social media, and seek feedback from others.
