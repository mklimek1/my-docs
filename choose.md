Tools. What tools are the most popular among open-source technical writers?
There are many tools that are popular among open-source technical writers, and the choice of tools often depends on the specific project and the preferences of the writer. Here are some of the most popular tools used by open-source technical writers:

1. Markdown editors: Markdown is a simple and lightweight markup language that is widely used for writing documentation. Markdown editors, such as [Typora](https://typora.io/) (free) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free) make it easy to write and format Markdown documents.
2. Version control systems: Version control systems, such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (free) or [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) (free), are essential for managing documentation in open-source projects. They allow multiple contributors to work on the same document, track changes, and collaborate effectively.
3. Documentation generators: Documentation generators, such as [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)(free), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (free), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (free), are tools that generate documentation from source code or other structured data. They can generate documentation in various formats, such as HTML, PDF, and EPUB.
4. Graphic design tools: Graphic design tools, such as [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/pl/products/illustrator.html?gclid=CjwKCAjw1YCkBhAOEiwA5aN4ATwn8zSdySnKeZzM9_tBQcc5DGIAD5TSAJtjaGdTiJMVyX_iMrlbnxoC4dcQAvD_BwE&skwcid=AL!3085!3!601096058101!e!!g!!adobe%20illustrator&mv=search&sdid=KCJMVLF6&ef_id=CjwKCAjw1YCkBhAOEiwA5aN4ATwn8zSdySnKeZzM9_tBQcc5DGIAD5TSAJtjaGdTiJMVyX_iMrlbnxoC4dcQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!601096058101!e!!g!!adobe%20illustrator!1478481577!58339249438&gad=1) (paid), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (free), and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (free), are used for creating diagrams, illustrations, and other visual elements in technical documentation.
5. Translation management tools: Open-source projects often have contributors from all over the world, and translation management tools, such as [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/)(free and paid plans), [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) (free and paid plans), and [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/) (free and paid plans), make it easy to manage translations of documentation into multiple languages.
6. Content management systems: [WordPress](https://pl.wordpress.org/) (free and paid plans) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) (free and paid plans), are used for managing and publishing large amounts of content, such as documentation, tutorials, and blog posts.

### Key takeaways

In summary, open-source technical writers use a variety of tools, including Markdown editors, version control systems, documentation generators, graphic design tools, translation management tools, and content management systems, to create and manage technical documentation for open-source projects.
