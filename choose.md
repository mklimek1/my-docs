4. Graphic design tools: Graphic design tools, such as Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, and GIMP, are used for creating diagrams, illustrations, and other visual elements in technical documentation.
5. Translation management tools: Open-source projects often have contributors from all over the world, and translation management tools, such as Crowdin, Transifex, and POEditor, make it easy to manage translations of documentation into multiple languages.
6. Content management systems: WordPress and Drupal, are used for managing and publishing large amounts of content, such as documentation, tutorials, and blog posts.
