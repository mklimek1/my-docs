## 8. Collaborate

### Collaboration in Open Source

Collaboration and communication are essential for technical writers who want to create effective documentation for open-source projects. By working closely with developers, designers, and other stakeholders, technical writers gain a deeper understanding of the project and its goals. Technical writers should communicate regularly with the project community to ensure that their work is aligned with the project's goals and values. This understanding allows them to create documentation that accurately reflects the project's values and meets the needs of the intended audience.

Collaboration also ensures that technical writers are not working in a vacuum. By involving other stakeholders in the documentation process, technical writers receive valuable feedback on their work and make necessary adjustments to improve the quality of the documentation and to ensure that their documentation accurately reflects the software's features and functionality. This feedback can come from developers who know the software best, designers who ensure that the documentation is visually appealing, and other contributors who provide different perspectives and insights. By working collaboratively and communicating effectively, technical writers can create documentation that is accurate, comprehensive, and easy to understand for users. Simply put - technical writers receive feedback to write better and to better understand what they are writing about.
