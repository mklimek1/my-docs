## 3. Find

There are several ways for technical writers to find and identify open source projects that align with their interests and skills:

1. Browse GitHub: [GitHub](https://github.com) is a popular platform for hosting open source projects. Technical writers can browse GitHub to discover open source projects that align with their interests, and explore their documentation to identify gaps and areas that need improvement.

2. Check Open Source Directories: There are several open source directories like [Open Source Directory](https://opensourcesoftwaredirectory.com/), [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore?new), and [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) that list thousands of open source projects. Technical writers can search these directories based on their interests, programming languages, and project type.

3. Attend Open Source Conferences and Meetups: Open source conferences and meetups are excellent places to network and discover open source projects. Technical writers can attend these events to learn about the latest trends, tools, and opportunities in the open source community. Check e.g. [Open Source Summit Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/) or [SCaLE Conference](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x).

4. Join Online Communities: Online communities like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackexchange.github.io/), and [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-is-open-source-software) have dedicated spaces for open source discussions. Technical writers can join these communities to interact with developers, identify open source projects, and contribute to the community.

5. Participate in Open Source Programs: Google Summer of Code, Outreachy, and OpenHatch are open source programs that offer paid internships and mentorship to students and beginners. Technical writers can participate in these programs to gain hands-on experience in open source projects, and contribute to their documentation.

## The subjective worth taking a look at open source project list

1. [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ "Google Summer of Code"): Google Summer of Code is an annual program that offers paid internships to students to work on open-source projects. Technical writers can participate in this program to gain hands-on experience in open-source documentation projects. The program typically opens for applications in the first quarter of the year, and the application deadline is usually in late March. 

2. [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/ "Outreachy"): Outreachy is a global program that provides internships and mentorship to people from underrepresented groups in tech to work on open-source projects. Technical writers can participate in this program to gain experience in writing technical documentation for open-source projects. The program typically opens for applications in the first quarter of the year, and the application deadline is usually in late March.

3. [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/mozilla-open-leaders/ "Mozilla Open Leaders"): Mozilla Open Leaders is a mentorship program that provides training and support to people who want to become open-source leaders. Technical writers can participate in this program to learn about open-source culture, community building, and documentation best practices. The program typically opens for applications in the second quarter of the year.

4. [OpenHatch](http://openhatch.org/ "OpenHatch"): OpenHatch is a non-profit organization that helps newcomers find their way into the world of open source. Technical writers can find open-source projects on the OpenHatch website and contribute to their documentation. The website has a section called "Bitesize Tasks" that lists small tasks that beginners can work on to get started in open source.

### Key takeaways

To conclude, technical writers can find and identify open source projects by browsing GitHub, checking open source directories, attending open source conferences and meetups, joining online communities, and participating in open source programs. Once they have identified a project of their interest, they can familiarize themselves with the project's goals, architecture, and user personas, and evaluate its existing documentation to identify gaps and areas that need improvement. Google Summer of Code, Outreachy, Mozilla Open Leaders, and OpenHatch are some of the resources that technical writersâ€™ beginners can explore to find open-source projects and opportunities. It's important to note that the availability of these programs and opportunities may vary from year to year, and interested individuals should check their websites for the latest information.
