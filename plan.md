## 1. Plan

Here is a project plan that outlines how technical writers can contribute to open source projects:

1. Identify the Project: Technical writers should research and identify an open source project that aligns with their interest and experience. It's important to choose a project that has a dedicated community, active development, and documentation that needs improvement.
To see examples of projects which might be worth consideration go to [3. Find](find.md)

2. Understand the Project: Before diving into the documentation, technical writers should familiarize themselves with the project's goals, architecture, features, and user personas. Understanding the project in depth will help writers create documentation that meets the needs of the intended audience.

3. Evaluate the Existing Documentation: Technical writers should evaluate the existing documentation to identify gaps, outdated information, and unclear instructions. They should also check if the documentation adheres to industry standards and best practices.

4. Plan the Documentation: Based on the evaluation, technical writers should plan the documentation by creating a content outline, choosing a format, and determining the scope and audience. The documentation plan should be shared with the project community for feedback and approval.

5. Write the Documentation: Technical writers should write clear, concise, and easy-to-follow documentation that covers all aspects of the software. They should ensure that the documentation is accessible, inclusive, and engaging. Technical writers should also collaborate with the project community to ensure that the documentation is accurate and up-to-date.

6. Review and Edit: Once the documentation is complete, technical writers should review and edit it to ensure that it meets the project's standards and adheres to industry best practices. They should also ensure that the documentation is consistent in terms of tone, style, and formatting. There are usually peer reviewers in the team, who know the stylesheet and they may cover review in terms of internal standards (there might be also a QA specialist dedicated for documentation only), but also there should happen the SME's (Subject Matter Expert's) review, who checks documentation in terms of correctnes of the information.

7. Publish and Maintain: After the documentation is reviewed and edited, technical writers should publish it on the project's website and make it easily accessible to users e.g. using help or FAQ section, so that it is intuitive where to find guidlines. They should also maintain the documentation by updating it regularly to reflect changes in the software and feedback from users.

8. Promote the Documentation: Finally, technical writers should promote the documentation to the project community, social media, and relevant forums to increase its visibility and reach. They should also encourage users to provide feedback and suggest improvements to the documentation.

### Key takeaways

In summary, technical writers can contribute to open source projects by creating and maintaining documentation that helps users understand and use the software. By following the project plan outlined above, technical writers can make a significant and valuable contribution to the success of an open source project.
