# Here are some questions to consider when deciding if you would be a good fit for open-source technical writing versus working as a technical writer for a software company

1. How much do you value collaboration and community involvement? If you enjoy working with a team and contributing to a project that has a wider impact, open-source technical writing may be a good fit for you. If you prefer working within the structure of a single company and contributing to internal projects, a full-time technical writing role at a software company may be a better fit.
2. Are you comfortable with self-directed work?
In open-source technical writing, you will need to manage your own time and set your own priorities, which requires a certain level of self-direction. If you prefer a more structured work environment with clear guidelines and expectations, a full-time role at a software company may be a better fit.
3. How important is work-life balance to you? Open-source projects can be demanding, with contributors working on a volunteer basis and often needing to balance their contributions with other commitments. If you value work-life balance and prefer a structured work schedule, a full-time role at a software company may be a better fit.
By considering these questions and others that are important to you, you can better determine whether open-source technical writing or a full-time technical writing role at a software company is the right fit for your interests, work style, and career goals.
Conclusion
Being a technical writer in open-source projects sometimes requires being flexible, self-driven, clever, and full of ideas. On the one hand it gives one more freedom than regular 9-to-5 position, but on the other it requires more independency and perseverance. Open-source is also for people who like changes and are curious to learn new technologies.  Therefore – working in and open-source is not for everyone, because “with great power comes great responsibility”.
