### Usability testing and feedback

Usability testing and feedback from users are essential for creating effective documentation. Technical writers should seek feedback from users to ensure that the documentation meets their needs and effectively communicates information. By gathering feedback, technical writers can identify areas where the documentation may be unclear or confusing and make adjustments to improve its effectiveness.
Usability testing can also help technical writers identify areas where the software itself may be difficult to use or understand. By testing the documentation with real users, technical writers can identify common problems or areas of confusion and work with developers to improve the software's usability. This collaboration between technical writers and developers can ultimately lead to better software and a better user experience.

Furthermore, feedback from users can help technical writers stay up to date with changes in the software and user needs. As software evolves, technical writers must ensure that the documentation accurately reflects those changes and continues to provide value to users. By seeking feedback and incorporating it into their work, technical writers can ensure that the documentation remains relevant and effective over time.

Documentation is only complete when it is verified as having served its purpose for the user, and not before. All sorts of bugs and complications might be thrown up during usability testing, which must be resolved before testing can be completed.

What do you need to do to properly test the documentation? 

1.  Review Table of Contents 
The table of contents is the representation of all the pages and sections that are included in your documentation and must be verified for accuracy. Is it laid out in a way that makes sense to your users and enables them to find what they are looking for? Are the links to each page or section working, allowing your users to jump to their desired page?

2. Review the terminology 
Your product name, and including reference to all its features, should be used consistently and accurately. Customers may not use precisely the terms that you use, but if you apply them in a way that makes sense then your customers will understand what they mean. There should be agreement among the documentation, product and other teams over your product name.

3. Branding
It’s almost certain that your project will have a style guide. A style guide is a document that sets out rules for writing documentation, how it should look, the use of logos, and so on. This ensures consistency throughout your documentation and that you speak with a uniform brand voice.

4. Version 
Ensure you are using the most up-to-date version of your documentation across the board and that any revisions have been applied. Usability testing won’t work if users, subject matter experts and so on are using different versions of your content, and your documentation will quickly sprawl out of hand. Every time you receive feedback on a version of your documentation, it should be updated as a new version.

5. Content Accuracy
Documentation should be accurate in that it reflects the product’s capabilities and operation. If following the given instructions does not produce the results shown, then users will lose faith in the documentation and perhaps abandon the product altogether. Inaccurate documentation results in a high level of frustration and disappointed expectations, so check your documentation for accuracy as much as possible.

6. Readability
You should analyze your documentation for its readability, so how easy it is for users to read, absorb, and comprehend your instructions. Many factors affect how readable your documentation is, ranging from sentence length to paragraph length to length and choice of words used. Choice of visuals such as images and videos also have an impact. Ideally, unless your documentation is aimed at a highly technical audience, your documentation should not require a college degree to understand.

7. Glossary
You should check whether your glossary of terms is accurate and if it contains all of the terms used within your documentation. Ideally, you will not be using more than one term to refer to the same thing, or your users will get confused. Each term should be in alphabetical order and properly explained for the comprehension of your users. Different parts of your documentation can link to the glossary for further explanation.

8. Navigation and Search
How easy is it for your users to navigate and search your documentation? Can they quickly find what they need, or are they prone to giving up before they locate the right results? It doesn’t matter how good your documentation is if users are cannot make use of navigation and search. Navigation allows your users to explore your documentation while search takes them directly to the right page or section. Search should be sensitive to typos and variation in search terms.

## How to Test Technical Documentation Usability?
You can choose one of the few echniques or apply more than one to perform documentation usability testing. 

How Can I Test a Document?
Here are three ways to test the usability of documents:

### Paraphrase Testing
“Tell me in your own words.” - This is called paraphrase testing.
Paraphrase testing is when you ask documentation users to repeat your documentation back to you in their own words, to check that they understand it. Testers go through your documentation section by section to give their feedback, and this also tells you whether you have packed too much information into a sentence or paragraph. If users can’t repeat your documentation back to you, then you need to improve comprehension. Paraphrase testing is a very thorough way to test your documentation.

This method also works for longer documents that people must read from beginning to end—such as a contract or legal brief.

You’ll learn whether

- The document’s organization makes sense to your participants
- Your paragraphs and sentences are short enough for people to get all the parts
- The words you use are ones your participants understand
- You’ll also hear whether participants use different words from those in the document.

### Plus-Minus Testing 
“Mark positives and negatives.” - This is the plus–minus testing technique that Dutch researchers Menno de Jong and Peter Jan Schellens devised.
Plus-minus testing uses pluses and minuses that your testers mark against particular sections of your documentation to convey whether they had a positive or negative reading experience. Plus-minus testing reveals the users’ emotional reactions have to your documentation and then the reasons for their ratings are explored in individual interviews. It can also tell you any information that you need to add or subtract in your documentation based on user feedback.

You can use plus–minus to

- Probe for your participants’ opinions about what is clear and what is not clear to them
- Get people’s emotional reactions to a document
- Investigate some other attribute such as confidence in the organization

### Task-Based Testing
“Find an answer or do something.” - This is known as task-based testing.
Just as the name says, task-based testing determines how easy it is for users to find and use information to complete specific tasks. This approach works well for documentation that isn’t intended to be read from beginning to end, such as user guides and manuals. You should examine the journey that users take from the start and the path they follow to achieve their goal. If users are unsuccessful at finding information, you know that your documentation needs some work.

Task-based helps with:
Proividing only essential information. The reader here is really a user who wants to read only what is necessary. Finding the right place is critical. The reader first finds where the information is; then perhaps skims and scans to read just enough to get the answer, check the fact, or follow the instructions.

For each test session using these techniques, you will need a facilitator—probably you—and a participant—one of the people who would be likely to use the document. If possible, it’s great if you can also have a notetaker, as you would for any other usability testing.


## Best Practices for Testing Documentation

### Test with Real Users
Before you conduct your documentation usability testing, you should have a clear picture of who your documentation is aimed at. Real users are unlikely to have prior knowledge of your product so testing with them is vital. Insiders from the company often have valuable insight but your documentation must be targeted at real users, in order to see how your documentation will play out in real life.

### Leave Enough Time for Testing
In the rush to get a product ready for market, documentation often gets left on the backburner. Make sure your definition of complete is reached only after you have conducted documentation testing, and not before. All teams should be educated on the importance of testing the documentation, without which the product risks being a failure with its target users.

### Analyze Your Results
Have a system for analyzing the results of your documentation testing. This means that when you receive your results, you should effectively apply the feedback you collect to make positive changes. Don’t be disheartened if users find your documentation difficult to use – you have learned something for next time.

### Know What You Want to Aim for
When testing your documentation, you need to have a goal for your content so you can recognize when you have reached it. One example of a goal might be making your documentation more accessible for your users. When you know what you want to aim for, you will be able to select tests that provide relevant insight into your progress.

## Feedback 

What is more, users' feedback refers to the personal viewpoints of customers regarding your documentation. It offers comprehensive insights into the influence of products, services, or overall business strategies on them. Users can express their thoughts on the usefulness of your documentation through comments, feedback, emojis, or "reactions." Consequently, user feedback serves as a means to emphasize the overall customer experience and level of satisfaction.

### Ways to collect users feedback 
1. Enable Customer Comments On Documentation
2. Collect Emojis Feedback On Documentation 
3. Provide Instant Answer Support via Chatbot
4. Provide Email Surveys & Measure Result
5. Monitor Your Social Share Channels
