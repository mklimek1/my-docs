## Role of documentation in software development process

Documentation plays a critical role in the software development process, and technical writers contribute significantly to its progress by providing clear and concise instructions for testing, deployment, and maintenance. Good documentation not only saves time and effort for developers and users but also enhances the overall quality of the software. Technical writers should understand the software development life cycle, including the different stages of development, testing, and deployment, and how documentation supports each stage.

By providing detailed documentation, technical writers provide assistance to developers on how to troubleshoot and debug issues, identify and fix bugs, and maintain the software more effectively. Furthermore, good documentation helps to onboard new developers and reduce the learning curve, which ultimately improves the efficiency and productivity of the development team.
When it comes to developers' documentation we can devide it to 
- developers' documentation which highlights adopted principles, concepts, algorithms to allow them smoothly do debugging and testing
- documentation for developers who are noew to the project, to ensure their indroduction runs soomthly and allows them to discover projects principles on their own, reducing time spent on shadow learning by developers who are already fammiliar with the product, code and documentation

Documentation is also essential for users, esspecially new users who need to familiarize themselves with the product and project. Technical writers should understand the user's perspective, their goals, and their level of technical expertise, and create documentation that is accessible, inclusive, and easy to follow. Well-written documentation helps users to get up and running quickly, troubleshoot issues, and take advantage of the software's features and functionalities. Ultimately, good documentation improves the user experience, and thus enhances the overall success of the software.
